/**

 * 
 *         Static block initialization implementation is similar to eager
 *         initialization, except that instance of the class is created in the
 *         static block that provides the option for exception handling.
 * 
 *         Both eager initialization and static block initialization create the
 *         instance even before itâ€™s being used and that is not the best
 *         practice to use.
 *         
 *         drawback
 *         lack of lazy initializatiion
 *         it will create the object earlier
