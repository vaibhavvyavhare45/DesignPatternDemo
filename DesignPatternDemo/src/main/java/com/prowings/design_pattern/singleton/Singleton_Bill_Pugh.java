/**

 * 
 *         Prior to Java 5, the Java memory model had a lot of issues, and the
 *         previous approaches used to fail in certain scenarios where too many
 *         threads tried to get the instance of the singleton class
 *         simultaneously. So Bill Pugh came up with a different approach to
 *         create the singleton class using an inner static helper class. Here
 *         is an example of the Bill Pugh Singleton implementation:
 * 
 *         Notice the private inner static class that contains the instance of
 *         the singleton class. When the singleton class is loaded,
 *         SingletonHelper class is not loaded into memory and only when someone
 *         calls the getInstance() method, this class gets loaded and creates
 *         the singleton class instance. This is the most widely used approach
 *         for the singleton class as it doesnâ€™t require synchronization.
